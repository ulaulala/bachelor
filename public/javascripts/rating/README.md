# rating

Star rating widget.

## Example

Create a 5-star rating widget, add it to them DOM and get updates about its state.

Make sure that you style the `.glow` class so you can actually see the stars changing.

```js
var Rating = require('rating');

var rating = new Rating([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
document.body.appendChild(rating.el);

rating.on('rate', function(weight) {
  console.log('rated: ' + weight);
});

rating.on('current', function(weight) {
  console.log('current: ' + weight);
});
```

## Custom dom

Instead of using the default DOM you can provide your own:

```html
<span class="rating">
  <span class="star">â˜…</span>
</span>
```

```js
var Rating = require('rating');

var container = document.querySelector('.rating');
var star = document.querySelector('.star');
star.parentNode.removeChild(star);

var rating = new Rating([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], {
  container: container,
  star: star
});

rating.on('rate', function(weight) {
  console.log('rated: ' + weight);
});

rating.on('select', function(weight) {
  console.log('current: ' + weight);
});
```

## API

### Rating(weights[, opts])

Create a new rating widget with the given array of `weights`.

Make sure that you style the `.glow` class so you can actually see the stars changing.

Possible options:

* `container (Element)`: Instead of creating a new DOM element for the widget, render everything into `container`.
* `star (Element)`: Clone the `star` element for every star that is to be shown, instead of using the default star element.
* `readOnly (Boolean)`: If `true`, the rating can't be modified.

### Rating#el

The widget's dom element.

### Rating#set(weight)

Set the current `weight`.

### Rating#on('rate', fn)

Calls `fn` with the the weight the user chose by clicking on a star, or when you set it via `Rating#set` manually.

### Rating#on('select', fn)

Calls `fn` with the current selected `weight`.
